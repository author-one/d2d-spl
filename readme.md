Discrete-to-Deep Supervised Policy Learning (D2D-SPL) vs. DQN using OpenAI gym's CartPole environment.

Requirements:
- Python 3, numpy, Scikit-learn
- OpenAI Gym
- PyTorch

Running D2D-SPL
- Run cartpole_d2dspl_train.py. A 'results' directory containing all the results will be created
- Run cartpole_d2dspl_test.py to test

Running DQN
- Run cartpole_dqn_train.py
- Run cartpole_dqn_test.py
